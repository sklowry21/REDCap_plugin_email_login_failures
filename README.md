# REDCap_plugin_email_login_failures
Plugin that reports on login failures for people with too many failures in the last xx hours

Near the top of the PHP file, there are some variables set which you might want to change.
You need to at least change the email addresses because Sue Lowry doesn't want to receive your emails.
